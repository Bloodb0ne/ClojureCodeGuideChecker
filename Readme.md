<pre>Basic idea</pre>
This project has the idea to create a toolset checking
if a clojure file is conforming to the conventions conveyed
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide">here</a>.
From the start i will be writing it in clojure, but later i could make
imperative style parser in js for easy integration into web applications(form validation e.t.c).
